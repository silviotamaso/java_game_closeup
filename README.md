CLOSEUP Java Game

Simple game made using Java 1.0 and featured at the Brazilian website of Close Up toothpaste, from Lever (closeup.com.br), in February 1997.

Everything here weights 106 kbytes. In a world wired in dialled phone lines with velocities like 33600 Kbps, with pages full of texts, few and small images and all of them static ones, this is what people had in mind when someone talks about "multimedia art", lol. Designs chewed as hardcore pixel art (8 bit max), audio down sampled at the minimum acceptable and cut sharp. At that time, this was truly mind-blowing.
